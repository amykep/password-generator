# password-generator:Third Week Challenge

## Steps to solve this week challenge:
 1. Created variable for every password criteria. 
 2. Created a function for every password criteria to confirm user decision on using or not using this criteria, console log and return the value.
 3. For password length; I added a do-while loop to check and ensure password length is between 8 and 128.
 4. Created random generation function to generate random length between 8 and 128 in case user didn't enter password length.
 5. Created Validation function to validate that user has at least chose one charcter type criteria.
 6. Created  random generation functions to generate random numbers, uppercase characters, lower case characters and special character.
