# password-generator:Third Week Challenge

## Steps to solve this week challenge:
 1. Created variable for every password crit  criteria 
 2. Created a function for every password criteria to confirm user decision on using or not using this criteria, console log and return the value
 3. For password length; I added a do-while loop to check and ensure password length is between 8 and 128
 4. Created random generation function to generate random length between 8 and 128 in case user didn't enter password length.
